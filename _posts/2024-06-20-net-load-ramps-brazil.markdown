The main reasons to analyze the magnitude of load ramps, specially net load ramps (NL) in the brazilian system, are listed as follows:

<ol>
    <li>Integration of large shares of inverter-based sources (IBS) in the national grid.</li>
    <li>Increase power system “Flexibility” requirements.</li>
    <li>Net Load Ramp quantification.</li>
    <li>Avoid “Cycling” damage in thermal power plants.</li>
</ol>
