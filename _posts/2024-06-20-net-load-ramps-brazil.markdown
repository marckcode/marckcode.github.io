The main reasons to analyze the magnitude of load ramps, specially net load ramps (NL) in the brazilian system, are listed as follows:

<ol>
    <li>Integration of large shares of inverter-based sources (IBS) in the national grid.</li>
    <li>Increase power system “Flexibility” requirements.</li>
    <li>Net Load Ramp quantification.</li>
    <li>Avoid “Cycling” damage in thermal power plants.</li>
</ol>

It is important to note that this work was inspired in the analysis that GridStatus made on the CAISO and ERCOT power grid systems.

This article related to the ENGIE Brazil project called "Methodologies for Identification of Operational Constraints in Energy Systems with High
Penetration of Variable Renewable Energy Sources" (FERV, in portuguese), outlines the relevance of the Net Load Ramp analysis and its repercusion 
on the brazilian power grid of the future.
